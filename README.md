GAME STUDIO: MAKE YOUR OWN GAME: PLAY, EXTEND, SHARE &amp; HAVE FUN!” 

The main idea behind this project is to create a community-oriented consumer business by empowering users to create their own engaging content through easy to use and intuitive experiences.  The strategy is to help customers create, deliver and monetize digital content.

Introducing Game Studio, a touch app where users create & play their own games or share their games or even extend games created by others. Game Studio’s mission is to help (GameGods) create new game genres and help  prosumers build engaging targeted gaming experiences based on these genres and deliver them to their social circles. In Game Studio, creating a game is super simple:  Using touch gestures, just place the game objects, play around with the customization options & you are done!

If that’s not enough, you can also:
- Play games created by Game Studio users
- Extend a game by adding levels
- Create game objects for others to use in the game 
- Share your games with your friends and people from all over the world
- Share the art you create or download other people's art and make games with it.
- Earn virtual currency each time you play a game or someone plays your game, then spend it downloading more games and art.

Note: At present the basic infrastructure for building above mentioned features is in place. All the features mentioned above are not be available in the present code.
